## Initialization

<Warning>
This only covers the backend initialization with Express. You will also need to initialize your frontend. For example, [React](/sdk/react) or [Next.js](/sdk/next).
</Warning>

Initializing the Atlas SDK is very easy. You just need to follow these steps:

<Steps>

<Step title="Set the Atlas API key in the environment variables">

You can get it from the [Atlas Dashboard](https://app.runonatlas.com).

```bash .env
ATLAS_API_KEY="INSERT_YOUR_ATLAS_API_KEY"
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create the Atlas Express Client">

To initialize the Atlas SDK, you need to instantiate the Atlas Client with the following parameters:

1. Your Atlas API key.
2. A function that returns the user id given a request object.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using Clerk">
    When using Clerk, you just need to pass the getAuth function to get the userId.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```typescript src/atlas/server.ts [expandable] {6-11}
    import { AtlasExpressClient } from "@runonatlas/express";
    import { getAuth } from "@clerk/express";
    import express from "express";

    const app = express();
    const atlas = new AtlasExpressClient(
      process.env.ATLAS_API_KEY,
      (req) => getAuth(req).userId
    );

    app.use("/", atlas.router);
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using any authentication provider">
    You just need to pass a function that returns the userId from the request.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```typescript src/atlas/server.ts [expandable] {6-11}
    import { AtlasExpressClient } from "@runonatlas/express";
    import express from "express";
    import { getUserIdFromRequest } from "your-auth-provider";

    const app = express();
    const atlas = new AtlasExpressClient(
      process.env.ATLAS_API_KEY,
      (req) => getUserIdFromRequest(req)
    );

    app.use("/", atlas.router);
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

## Limit user access based on their subscriptions

You can prevent users from accessing restricted parts of your application based on their subscription. To do so, you can use our backend protection features.

### Backend Protection

In order to prevent users from using certain endpoints unless they have a plan with the required features, we only need to add a middleware.

```typescript {3}
app.post(
  "/api/generate-caption",
  atlas.createFeaturesMiddleware(["data-explorer"]), // Add this line
  (req, res) => {
    // Your endpoint logic here
  }
);
```

This will automatically prevent users who don't have the data-explorer feature in their active plan from accessing the endpoint.

<Warning>
  Remember that you need to have followed the [installation guide](#installation) before you can use any of these features.
