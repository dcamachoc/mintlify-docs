description: "`@runonatlas/core` is our JavaScript/TypeScript library for Atlas, which provides the base client for direct integration with Atlas services."

<Warning>
  This guide is for direct JavaScript/TypeScript integration. If you're using one of our supported frameworks, we recommend using their dedicated SDKs instead:
  
  - [Next.js SDK](/sdk/next) - For Next.js applications
  - [React SDK](/sdk/react) - For React applications
  - [Express SDK](/sdk/express) - For Express.js applications
  
  These framework-specific SDKs provide better integration and additional features tailored to each framework.
</Warning>

## Initialization

<Steps>
<Step title="Set the Atlas API key in the environment variables">

You can get it from the [Atlas Dashboard](https://app.runonatlas.com).

```bash .env
ATLAS_API_KEY="INSERT_YOUR_ATLAS_API_KEY"
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create the Atlas Client">

To initialize the Atlas SDK, you need to instantiate the Atlas Client with your API key:

```typescript src/atlas/client.ts [expandable]
import { AtlasClient } from "@runonatlas/core";

const atlas = new AtlasClient(process.env.ATLAS_API_KEY!);
```


</Step>
</Steps>

## Core Features

The Atlas JavaScript client provides several methods to interact with Atlas services:

### Feature Management

#### Register Features

Register features that your application uses:

```typescript
// Register a single feature
await atlas.registerFeatureIfNotExists("data-explorer");

// Register multiple features
await atlas.registerFeaturesIfNotExist(["data-explorer", "ai-assistant"]);
```

The feature registration is used to ensure that the feature is registered in Atlas. If the feature is not registered, it will be registered automatically and an alert will be sent to the administrators.

#### Check Feature Access

Check if a customer has access to specific features:

```typescript
const { ok, features } = await atlas.areFeaturesAllowed("customer-123", [
  "data-explorer",
  "ai-assistant",
]);

if (ok) {
  // Customer has access to all required features
} else {
  // Check individual feature access
  console.log(features); // { "data-explorer": true, "ai-assistant": false }
}
```

### Customer Management

#### Get Customer Features

Retrieve all features a customer has access to:

```typescript
const features = await atlas.getCustomerFeatures("customer-123");
console.log(features); // ["data-explorer", "basic-features"]
```

#### Get Customer Details

Get detailed information about a customer:

```typescript
const customer = await atlas.getCustomerDetails("customer-123");
console.log(customer); // { id: "customer-123", name: "John Doe", ... }
```

### Pricing Model

Get information about your pricing model:

```typescript
const pricingModel = await atlas.getPricingModel();
console.log(pricingModel); // { plans: [...], features: [...] }
```
