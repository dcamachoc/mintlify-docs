## Initialization

<Warning>
This only covers the frontend initialization with React. You will also need to initialize your backend. For example, [Express](/sdk/express).
</Warning>

To initialize your frontend application, you need to create a client provider component and wrap your application with it. Since Atlas needs to authenticate with your backend and verify that users are only accessing what they can, you will need to place it under your authentication provider.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using Clerk">
    When using Clerk, you just need to pass the getAuth function and the userId to the Atlas Provider.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```typescript src/atlas/client.tsx [expandable]
    import { useAuth } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
    import { AtlasProvider } from "@runonatlas/react";

    export function AtlasClientProvider({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode;
    }) {
      const { userId, getToken } = useAuth();

      return (
        <AtlasProvider getAuth={getToken} userId={userId}>
          {children}
        </AtlasProvider>
      );
    }
    ```

    ```typescript src/App.tsx [expandable]
    import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider>
          <AtlasClientProvider>
            <YourApp />
          </AtlasClientProvider>
        </ClerkProvider>
      );
    }
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using a cookie-based provider">
    When using a cookie-based provider, the authentication against your backend is done automatically. Hence, you just need to pass the `userId`.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```typescript src/atlas/client.tsx [expandable]
    import { AtlasProvider } from "@runonatlas/react";
    import { useCookieBasedAuthentication } from "your-auth-provider";

    export function AtlasClientProvider({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode;
    }) {
      const { userId } = useCookieBasedAuthentication(); // Change this for the hook you are using

      return (
        <AtlasProvider userId={userId}>
          {children}
        </AtlasProvider>
      );
    }
    ```

    ```typescript src/App.tsx [expandable]
    import { AuthenticationProvider } from "your-auth-provider";

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <AuthenticationProvider>
          <AtlasClientProvider>
            <YourApp />
          </AtlasClientProvider>
        </AuthenticationProvider>
      );
    }
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="Using a different host for your backend?" icon="server">
  You can specify the host of your backend when instantiating the provider.

```typescript
return (
  <AtlasProvider host="https://my-backend.domain.com">
    // Don't forget the other props!
    {children}
  </AtlasProvider>
);
```

</Accordion>

## Use our Atlas widgets

<Warning>
  Remember that you need to have followed the [installation guide](#installation) before you can use any of these widgets.
</Warning>

You can use any of our [Atlas widgets](https://atlas.runo.com/docs/widgets) in your React application by importing them from `@runonatlas/react`.
For example, to use the pricing component, you can do the following:

```typescript
import { PricingComponent } from "@runonatlas/react";

export default function Home() {
  return <PricingComponent />;
}
```

## Limit user access based on their subscriptions

You can prevent users from accessing restricted parts of your application based on their subscription. To do so, you can use our UI protection features.

### UI Protection

#### Using hooks

You can use the `useFeaturesAllowed` hook to check if a user has access to a feature.

```typescript
import { useFeaturesAllowed } from "@runonatlas/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { isAllowed } = useFeaturesAllowed(["feature-1", "feature-2"]);

  return (
    <div>
      Our system has determined that...
      {isAllowed ? "You have access to this feature!" : "You don't have access to this feature. Please upgrade your subscription!"}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Using components

You can use the `FeatureProtect` component to check if a user has access to a feature.

```typescript
import { FeatureProtect } from "@runonatlas/react";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <FeatureProtect
      disallowedFallback={<div>Oh, you don't have access to this cool feature. Upgrade now!</div>}
      features={["feature-1", "feature-2"]}
    >
      <div>Cool feature</div>
    </FeatureProtect>
  );
}
```
