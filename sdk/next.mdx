## Initialization

<Steps>
<Step title="Create the Atlas Provider">

To initialize the application, you need to create a client provider component and wrap your application with it. Since Atlas needs to authenticate with your backend and verify that users are only accessing what they can, you will need to place it under your authentication provider.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using Clerk">
    When using Clerk, you just need to pass the getAuth function and the userId to the Atlas Provider.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```typescript src/atlas/client.tsx [expandable]
    "use client";

    import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    import { AtlasProvider } from "@runonatlas/next/client";

    export function AtlasClientProvider({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode;
    }) {
      const { userId, getToken } = useAuth();

      return (
        <AtlasProvider getAuth={getToken} userId={userId}>
          {children}
        </AtlasProvider>
      );
    }
    ```


    ```typescript src/app/layout.tsx [expandable]
    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: Readonly<{
      children: React.ReactNode;
    }>) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider>
          <AtlasClientProvider>
    		<App />
          </AtlasClientProvider>
        </ClerkProvider>
      );
    }

    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using a cookie-based provider">
    When using a cookie-based provider, the authentication against your backend is done automatically. Hence, you just need to pass the `userId` .

    <CodeGroup>

    ```typescript src/atlas/client.tsx [expandable]
    "use client";

    import { AtlasProvider } from "@runonatlas/next/client";
    import { useCookieBasedAuthentication } from "your-auth-provider";

    export function AtlasClientProvider({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode;
    }) {
      const { userId } = useCookieBasedAuthentication(); // Change this for the hook you are using

      return (
        <AtlasProvider userId={userId}>
          {children}
        </AtlasProvider>
      );
    }
    ```


    ```typescript src/app/layout.tsx [expandable]
    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: Readonly<{
      children: React.ReactNode;
    }>) {
      return (
        <AuthenticationProvider>
          <AtlasClientProvider>
    		<App />
          </AtlasClientProvider>
        </AuthenticationProvider>
      );
    }

    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="Using a different host for your backend?" icon="server">
  You can specify the host of your backend when instantiating the provider.

```typescript
return (
  <AtlasProvider host="https://my-backend.domain.com">
    {" "}
    // Don't forget the other props!
    {children}
  </AtlasProvider>
);
```

</Accordion>

</Step>
<Step title="Create the Atlas API routes">

You will need to initialize the client in the backend. To do so, you will need to:

1. Set the Atlas API key in the environment variables.
2. Create the Atlas Next Server Client, providing the API key and a callback that returns the user that performed the request. This callback will depend on the authentication provider you are using.
3. Use the Atlas Next Server Client to create the API routes that will be used to access the Atlas API. They should be in the `src/app/api/atlas-api/[slug]/route.ts` file.

The result should be like this:

<CodeGroup>

```bash .env
ATLAS_API_KEY="INSERT_YOUR_ATLAS_API_KEY"
```

```typescript src/atlas/server.ts (Clerk example) [expandable]
import { AtlasNextServerClient } from "@runonatlas/private-next/server";
import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export const atlasServerClient = new AtlasNextServerClient(
  process.env.ATLAS_API_KEY!,
  async () => {
    const { userId } = await auth();

    return userId;
  }
);
```

```typescript src/app/api/atlas-api/[slug]/route.ts [expandable]
import { atlasServerClient } from "@/atlas/server";
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";

export async function GET(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ slug: string }> }
) {
  const { slug } = await params;

  return (
    atlasServerClient.router[slug]?.GET?.(request) ??
    new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })
  );
}

export async function POST(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ slug: string }> }
) {
  const { slug } = await params;

  return (
    atlasServerClient.router[slug]?.POST?.(request) ??
    new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })
  );
}
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Use our Atlas widgets

<Warning>
  Remember that you need to have followed the [installation
  guide](#installation) before you can use any of these widgets.
</Warning>

You can use any of our [Atlas widgets](https://atlas.runo.com/docs/widgets) in your Next.js application by importing them from `@runonatlas/next/client`.
For example, to use the pricing component, you can do the following:

```typescript
import { PricingComponent } from "@runonatlas/next/client";

export default function Home() {
  return <PricingComponent />;
}
```

## Limit user access based on their subscriptions

You can prevent users from accessing restricted parts of your application based on their subscription. To do so, it is important that you do it both in the UI and in the backend:

<Columns cols={2}>
<Card icon="desktop" title="UI Protection" href="#ui-protection">
Protecting the UI is the easiest way to prevent users from accessing restricted parts of your application.
</Card>
<Card icon="server" title="Backend Protection" href="#backend-protection">
Protecting the UI is cool, but not enough! You need to protect the backend as well. This way, you can ensure that users cannot access restricted parts of your application even if they bypass the UI.
</Card>
</Columns>

### UI Protection

#### Using hooks

You can use the `useFeaturesAllowed` hook to check if a user has access to a feature.

```typescript
import { useFeaturesAllowed } from "@runonatlas/next/client";

export default function Home() {
  const { isAllowed } = useFeaturesAllowed(["feature-1", "feature-2"]);

  return (
    <div>
      Our system has determined that...
      {isAllowed ? "You have access to this feature!" : "You don't have access to this feature. Please upgrade your subscription!"}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Using components

You can use the `FeatureProtect` component to check if a user has access to a feature.

```typescript
import { FeatureProtect } from "@runonatlas/next/client";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <FeatureProtect
      disallowedFallback={<div>Oh, you don't have access to this cool feature. Upgrade now!</div>}
      features={["feature-1", "feature-2"]}
    >
      <div>Cool feature</div>
    </FeatureProtect>
  );
}
```

#### Backend Protection

Using Atlas in the backend is **very easy**. You just need to use the `atlasServerClient` that we created before to check if a user has access to a feature.
For example, if you are using Clerk:

```typescript src/app/api/example/route.ts [expandable]
import { atlasServerClient } from "@/atlas/server";
import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export async function GET() {
  const { userId } = await auth();
  if (!userId) {
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
  }

  const { ok } = await atlasServerClient.areFeaturesAllowed(userId, [
    "data-explorerr",
  ]);

  if (!ok) {
    return new Response("You don't have this feature enabled", { status: 401 });
  }

  return new Response("Hello from the backend!!");
}
```
